# Titanic Machine Learning Model

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers including whether they survived or not. The datasets are available in the file.
## Files
- `titanic.csv`: The dataset containing information about passengers.
- `Titanic_ML_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, outlier analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building the machine learning model.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing the Python packages required to run the Jupyter Notebook.
